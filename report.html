  and fabrication of a core memory Arduino shield.</p>

<h3><span class="heading-number">1</span> Introduction</h3>

<h4><span class="heading-number">1.1</span> What is magnetic core memory?</h4>
<div class="marginnote">Core memory is an old memory technology.</div>
<p>
Magnetic core memory was the most widely used form of digital computer
memory from its birth in the early 1950s until the era of
integrated-circuit memory began in the early 1970s.  Aside from being
extremely reliable, magnetic core memory is an appealing technology
because it is based on a very simple idea.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">A <span class="emph">core</span>, a ring of magnetic material, stores one bit by the
  direction of its magnetisation.</div>
<p>
A <span class="emph">magnetic core</span> is a ring of ferrite material.  It can be
permanently magnetised either clockwise or anti-clockwise about its axis
just as a vertical bar magnet can be magnetised up or down.  We can then
turn a magnetic core into a bit of digital memory by letting these two
magnetisation states correspond to 0 and 1.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">It provides non-volatile storage.</div>
<p>
The core needs no power to retain its data.  In other words, core memory
is a form of non-volatile storage like modern hard disk drives, although
in its day it fulfilled the &lsquo;high-speed&rsquo; role of modern RAM.
<p>
With many such cores, large memory modules were made, such as this
example from a CDC machine of the mid-1960s.  The right-hand image shows
a close-up of the cores themselves.

</table>

<p>
<div class="marginnote">Cores were c.1mm across, and ran at c.1MHz.  Core stores
  had up to 500,000 cores.</div>
<p>
As the technology developed <a href="#Hilpert">[1]</a>, the cores shrank from
c.2mm diameter in the early 1950s to c.0.4mm by the early 1970s.
Access speeds rose at the same time, from about 200kHz to over 1MHz,
and core memory modules were manufactured with as many as over half a
million cores.  Furthermore, as recently as 2004, a magnetic core memory
system was found still in service in a telephony control system.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">It is still an interesting technology today.</div>
<p>
Magnetic core memory continues to capture the imaginations of modern
enthusiasts <a href="#Holder">[2]</a>, <a href="#Holme">[3]</a>, and it is also the origin of the term
<span class="emph">core dump</span>, to mean an on-disk image of the main memory of a process.
<p>

<h4><span class="heading-number">1.2</span> What is an Arduino?</h4>
<center>
<img src="Arduino-Duemilanove.jpg" width=288 height=201>
</center>
<p>
<div class="marginnote">The Arduino is a popular, easy-to-use, open design
  microprocessor board with IO capabilities.</div>
<p>
The Arduino, whose Duemilanove version is shown
above <a href="#arduino-photo">[5]</a>, is an open-source physical computing device.
It has removed many of the hurdles for people wishing to explore
embedded microprocessing.  An Arduino is a small single-board computer
based on an Atmel AVR microprocessor, with supporting components to
handle USB communications and provide easy access to input/output pins.
The developer programs the on-board microprocessor using an IDE running
on a PC.  It has proved very popular, with six-figure sales, and has
been used in projects as diverse as autopilots for radio-controlled
aeroplanes, and CNC sewing machines.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">Add-on <span class="emph">shields</span> exist, providing specialist interfacing or
  control functions.</div>
<p>
Several expansion modules exist, allowing the Arduino to perform a
greater variety of tasks.  These secondary modules, or <span class="emph">shields</span>,
are circuit boards that plug into the Arduino&rsquo;s pin headers, and supply
additional hardware to, for example, drive motors or servos, interface
with wireless communication modules, or communicate over Ethernet.
<p>

<h4><span class="heading-number">1.3</span> A core-store shield</h4>

<div class="marginnote">We set ourselves the challenge of creating a core
  memory Arduino shield.</div>
<p>
We had developed an interest in the principles and practice of core
memory, and the creation of a modern core memory module struck us as an
appealing challenge.  Eventually a pleasing idea suggested itself:  we
decided to build a magnetic core memory Arduino shield.
<p style="clear: both">
<div class="marginnote">New-old-stock cores; modern components.</div>
<p>
Our project was made possible thanks to the existence of a supply of
surplus ferrite cores manufactured in the 1980s for the magnetic core
memory systems of the time.  We decided that we would use these old
cores but permit ourselves to use modern components (transistors,
integrated-circuit logic gates, etc.).  This made our work enormously
easier than that of the original core memory inventors and
manufacturers.  Also, we knew that our end goal was possible.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">It worked.</div>
<p>
We succeeded in building an extremely reliable 32-bit core memory shield
for the Arduino.  It can be used as storage for the Arduino, or
alternatively, any modern computing device with a USB port can now read
and write to magnetic core memory.
<p>

<h3><span class="heading-number">2</span> Principles of core memory</h3>

<h4><span class="heading-number">2.1</span> Magnetic hysteresis</h4>

A ferrimagnetic substance has two distinct permanently magnetised
states.  In our case, these are clockwise and anti-clockwise round the
cores.  The key to their use as computer memory is their behaviour when
an external magnetic field is applied &mdash; they exhibit
<span class="emph">hysteresis</span>.
<p>

<h4>A weak external field has no effect</h4>

If we apply a weak external magnetic field around a core, and then
remove it, there is no lasting effect on the core&rsquo;s magnetisation:
<p>
<table class="figure">
  <tr>
  <td><span class="picexpl">Start off with a core magnetised in the anti-clockwise
  direction:</span></td>
  <td><span class="picexpl">Apply a weak clockwise external field.  This reduces the
  strength of the anti-clockwise magnetism in the core:</span></td>
  <td><span class="picexpl">But when the external field is removed, the magnetism in
  the core &lsquo;springs back&rsquo; to its original state:</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="pics">
  <td><img src="core-alone-med-acw-2.png" width=200 height=150></td>
  <td><img src="core-alone-sml-acw-1.png" width=200 height=150></td>
  <td><img src="core-alone-med-acw-2.png" width=200 height=150></td>
  </tr>
</table>
A weak anti-clockwise field similarly produces no lasting change.
<p>


<h4>Strong external fields cause the magnetisation to
  <span class="emph">switch</span></h4>

<p>However, if we apply a sufficiently strong magnetic field in the
opposite direction, the core will <span class="emph">switch</span>
from one magnetic state to the other:</p>

<table class="figure">
  <tr>
	<td><span class="picexpl">Start off with a core magnetised in the
    anti-clockwise direction:</span></td>
    <td><span class="picexpl">Apply a strong clockwise external field. This switches the
    core&rsquo;s magnetism, and the core now has clockwise magnetism:</span></td>
    <td><span class="picexpl">When this external field is removed, the magnetism in the
    core reduces slightly in strength, but remains clockwise:</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="pics">
    <td><img src="core-alone-med-acw-2.png" width=200 height=150></td>
    <td><img src="core-alone-lrg-cw-2.png" width=200 height=150></td>
    <td><img src="core-alone-med-cw-2.png" width=200 height=150></td>
  </tr>
</table>
A strong field in the same direction as the core&rsquo;s existing
magnetisation has no lasting effect &mdash; the core is <span class="emph">saturated</span> and
can be magnetised no further in that direction.
<p>

<h4><span class="heading-number">2.2</span> The magnetic field of a current-carrying wire</h4>

<div class="marginnote">Current in a wire creates a magnetic field.</div>
<p>
The next essential physical fact is that a DC current in a wire creates
a magnetic field circulating about the wire, whose strength is
proportional to the size of the current.  If we reverse the direction of
the current, the magnetic field circulates in the opposite direction:
<p>
<table class="figure">
  <tr>
	<td><span class="picexpl">Small current down; weak clockwise field</span></td>
	<td><span class="picexpl">Large  current down; strong clockwise field</span></td>
	<td><span class="picexpl">Small current up; weak anti-c/w field</span></td>
	<td><span class="picexpl">Large current up; strong anti-c/w field</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="pics">
	<td><img src="wire-field-sml-cw-1.png" width=128 height=96></td>
	<td><img src="wire-field-lrg-cw-1.png" width=128 height=96></td>
	<td><img src="wire-field-sml-acw-1.png" width=128 height=96></td>
	<td><img src="wire-field-lrg-acw-1.png" width=128 height=96></td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h4><span class="heading-number">2.3</span> Writing to a one-bit core memory system</h4>

<div class="marginnote">We can write a bit by driving appropriate currents.</div>
<p>
We now know enough to write one bit of core memory.  Having threaded a
wire through a core, we can cause the core to become magnetised in the
clockwise direction by passing a strong enough current in one direction
through the wire, and we can cause the core to become magnetised in the
anti-clockwise direction by passing a strong enough current in the
opposite direction.  These two operations correspond to writing 0 and 1
to the core.  The magnetisation of the core, and so the bit stored,
remains even after the current stops flowing.
<p>
<table class="figure">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="picexpl">The core is magnetised anti-clockwise, and therefore
    holds the bit 1.  No current flows through the wire.</span></td>
    <td><span class="picexpl">A large current is supplied, generating a strong
    magnetic field.  This switches the core&rsquo;s magnetisation to
    clockwise.</span></td>
    <td><span class="picexpl">When the current is turned off, the core remains
  	magnetised clockwise, therefore now holding 0.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="pics">
    <td><img src="acw-ready-to-switch.png" width=200 height=150></td>
    <td><img src="switch-to-cw-current.png" width=200 height=150></td>
    <td><img src="switched-to-cw.png" width=200 height=150></td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h4><span class="heading-number">2.4</span> Reading from a one-bit core memory system</h4>

<div class="marginnote">But: how do we <span class="emph">read</span> the state of the core?</div>
<p>
Core memory would probably have been a lot less popular had it been a
write-only technology.  To see how to read from the core, we need a
further piece of physics: a changing magnetic field induces a voltage.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">When a core switches, it induces a voltage.</div>
<p>
Consider a core which is magnetised anti-clockwise.  If we apply current
which tries to increase this anti-clockwise magnetisation, it does not
in fact change the magnetic field in the core much &mdash; it is already
saturated.  If, however, we apply enough current in the opposite
direction, the core switches to be magnetised clockwise, as shown above.
This process takes a small amount of time, around 1us for typical
cores.  During that time, the magnetic field is undergoing a large
change, and so induces a noticeable voltage.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">A second wire senses the induced voltage.</div>
<p>
The setup for reading the state of a core then is to have two wires
passing through the core.  We use one wire, the <span class="emph">drive line</span>, for
driving current back and forth and so to set the state of the core, and
we have circuitry connected to the second wire, the <span class="emph">sense line</span>,
to measure the induced voltages.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">To read: write a 0; check if the core switched.  If it did,
it was a 1.</div>
<p>
We start the process of reading the core by <span class="emph">writing</span> a 0 to it
using the drive line.  If we observe no significant induced voltage on
the sense line then we learn the core was already in state 0.  If,
however, we observe a large induced voltage on the sense line then we
learn that the core contained a 1 (and we then write 1 back to the
core).  The memory is said to operate with a <span class="emph">destructive read</span>.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">We measured the sense signals from our cores.</div>
<p>
At this point it may help to make this more concrete by exhibiting some
real data.  Below we present the results of one of our experiments in
which we measured the induced voltage on the sense line when writing 0
to a core which contained 1, and when writing 0 to a core which already
contained 0.
<p>
<table class="figure">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="picexpl">If a core switches from one magnetisation direction to the other,
    the changing magnetic field induces a voltage that peaks at c.35mV,
    staying above 20mV for c.600ns</span></td>
    <td><span class="picexpl">However, if the applied field is in the same direction as the
    core&rsquo;s existing magnetisation, no switching takes places, and we
    observe a negligible voltage:</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="pics">
    <td><img src="fig_20110505_1.png" width=252 height=72>
    <td><img src="fig_20110505_2.png" width=252 height=72>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
We also see voltage &lsquo;spikes&rsquo; caused by the drive line currents switching
on and off.  These <span class="emph">transformer-action</span> spikes are significant in
magnitude but are short and temporally separated from the switching
signal.  The pulse shown is in fact the base drive of transistors, and
the turn-on and turn-off delays are visible.
<p>
We could now build a one-bit read-write core memory system.


<h4><span class="heading-number">2.5</span> Arrays of cores and half-select currents</h4>

<div class="marginnote">Imposing only half the field leaves the core alone.</div>
<p>
However, we want to have more than one bit of memory without needing one
drive line per core.  We make use of a feature of the hysteresis
behaviour of the core.  We previously talked in terms of &lsquo;weak&rsquo; or
&lsquo;strong&rsquo; external magnetic fields.  Slightly more quantitatively:  the
core is <span class="emph">not</span> switched by a field which is half as strong as one
which is just strong enough to switch the core. The field is
proportional to the current in the drive line, so if we pass half the
current required to just switch a core through the drive line, the core
will not switch state.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">A 2-D array gives efficient control of every core.</div>
<p>
Now suppose we have $nm$ cores and we arrange them in an $n\times m$
rectangular array such that each core has one of $n$ horizontal and one
of $m$ vertical drive lines passing through it.  With this setup we can
selectively set the $(i, j)$th core and no other by simultaneously
driving the $i$th vertical drive line and $j$th horizontal drive line in
the appropriate directions, each with half the current required for
switching.  For example, in a $4\times4$ array, with the cores viewed
edge-on, we switch the core shown:
<p>
<img src="two-dml-array.png" width=640 height=203 align=left>
<p>
<div style="clear:both; padding-top: 0.75em">
We only need $O(\sqrt{N})$ drive lines for an array of $N$ cores.
In total, each core will have three wires threaded through it: two
perpendicular drive lines, and a sense line.  A single sense line can be
threaded through all cores in an array, a point we return to below.
</div>

<h4><span class="heading-number">2.6</span> Exploiting anti-coincidence</h4>

<div class="marginnote">One more trick doubles the number of cores we can address.</div>
<p>
The picture we should now have in mind of a core memory module is a
rectangular array of cores, with one vertical and one horizontal drive
line passing through each core.  There is a further drive-line economy,
which cuts in half the number of drive lines in one dimension.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">Two states out of four do nothing.</div>
<p>
Consider a core with its two drive lines.  There are then four
combinations of current direction.  Two combinations produce a
reinforcing field round the core, but in the other two, the fields
cancel round the core:
<p>
<table cellpadding=10>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="picexpl">Reinforce to write 0:</span></td>
    <td><span class="picexpl">Reinforce to write 1:</span></td>
    <td><span class="picexpl">Cancel; no effect:</span></td>
    <td><span class="picexpl">Cancel; no effect:</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="intersection-dr.png" width=128 height=64></td>
    <td><img src="intersection-ul.png" width=128 height=64></td>
    <td><img src="intersection-ur.png" width=128 height=64></td>
    <td><img src="intersection-dl.png" width=128 height=64></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
We say the currents or fields are <span class="emph">coincident</span> if they reinforce, and
<span class="emph">anti-coincident</span> if they cancel.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">We can use those two states.</div>
<p>
Now consider two cores arranged as below.  We still have two drive
lines, but we have turned one of the drive lines through two right
angles so that it passes through both cores but in opposite directions.
If we now consider the four possible simultaneous states of the drive
lines, we find that all possible combinations are put to use:
<p>
<table cellpadding=10>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="picexpl">Write 0 to left core:</span></td>
    <td><span class="picexpl">Write 1 to left core:</span></td>
    <td><span class="picexpl">Write 0 to right core:</span></td>
    <td><span class="picexpl">Write 1 to right core:</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="anti-coincidence-l0.png" width=128 height=64></td>
    <td><img src="anti-coincidence-l1.png" width=128 height=64></td>
    <td><img src="anti-coincidence-r0.png" width=128 height=64></td>
    <td><img src="anti-coincidence-r1.png" width=128 height=64></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
<div class="marginnote">One sense loop snakes through all cores.</div>
<p>
To take the concrete example of the small core array we built,
we show a $8\times4$ array.  We also now illustrate the single sense
line which runs through all cores.  The alternating alignment of the
cores makes the threading of the sense loop easier, and also reduces the
transformer-action spikes.
<p>
<img style="padding-bottom: 2.5ex" src="drive_lines_1.png"
     width=540 height=218 align="left">
<div style="clear:both">
<p>
The array of cores can be thought of as two halves, with each core in
the left half having an anti-coincident partner in the right half
sharing the same pair of drive lines.
</div>

<h3><span class="heading-number">3</span> Our implementation</h3>

To implement these principles, we have to solve a few fairly distinct
problems.  We must be able to drive current through the drive lines;
decide which drive lines need to have current driven through them; and
sense when an induced &lsquo;switching signal&rsquo; occurs.

<h4><span class="heading-number">3.1</span> A current-driving circuit</h4>

<div class="marginnote">The drive circuit is two copies ($X$ and $Y$) of one
problem: driving one of four lines in either direction.</div>
<p>
As noted above, we organise the 32-bit module as a rectangular array
with 4 rows and 8 columns in which the columns are paired as above using
anti-coincidence.  As a result, we have 4 vertical and 4 horizontal
drive lines to control.  Our current-driving problem is thus two
instances of the same problem: we need to be able to select one of four
lines, and to specify a direction in which to drive current along that
line.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">Drive the four lines as &lsquo;two by two&rsquo;.</div>
<p>
Our current sources and sinks are transistors, and we could accomplish
our goal by connecting each end of each drive line to the collectors of
both a PNP and an NPN transistor (i.e., by using four H-bridge
circuits).  This would work, but would be inefficient in terms of the
number of transistors used.  By introducing a few diodes, we can use a
design with half as many transistors.
<p>
By turning on the correct transistors in the following circuit, we can
send current in either direction through any of the drive lines.  The
resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ control how much current flows.  We discuss
their value below.
<center>
<img src="drive_line_circuit.png" width=440 height=412>
</center>

<h4>Calibrating the half-select current</h4>

<div class="marginnote">Experiments determine how much current we should use.</div>
<p>
As we have already discussed, it is important that we drive the right
amount of current.  It must be low enough that the magnetic field
produced by the current in one drive line is not enough to switch a
core, but high enough that the combined field from two coincident
currents does produce switching.  We determined the range of possible
values of current for our cores empirically and established that any
value in the range 250&ndash;340mA works.  We set the current by choosing
appropriate values for the resistors in the drive circuit above.

<h4><span class="heading-number">3.2</span> Addressing</h4>

<div class="marginnote">Which transistors should we turn on?</div>
<p>
In the circuit above, we want to know which transistors to turn on to
drive current left or right in one of the four lines.  We must be able
to pulse this current, and so we need to be able to stop all drive
currents.  Let the <span class="emph">enable</span> Boolean variable be $E$.  Let the variable
$D_X$ give the direction, with $D_X=0$ being leftwards.  In order to
drive the line $X_{A_1A_2}$ in the direction $D_X$ (as long as $E$ is
asserted), the base of transistor $Q^P_{11}$, for example, must be taken
high or low according to
$$Q^P_{11} = \overline{E \wedge D_X \wedge A_1}.$$
In words, $Q^P_{11}$ must be on (i.e., its base must be pulled low)
exactly when we are enabled ($E=1$) and we wish to drive current
rightwards ($D_X=1$) through either $X_{10}$ or $X_{11}$ (those two
lines have $A_1=1$).  The formulae for all eight transistors are:
<p>
<center>
<table class="transistor-eqns">
  <tr>
    <td>$Q^P_{10} = \overline{E \wedge D_X \wedge \overline{A_1}}$</td>
    <td>$Q^P_{20} = \overline{E \wedge \overline{D_X} \wedge \overline{A_2}}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="spacing"><td><div/></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$Q^N_{10} = E \wedge \overline{D_X} \wedge \overline{A_1}$</td>
    <td>$Q^N_{20} = E \wedge D_X \wedge \overline{A_2}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="spacing"><td><div/></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$Q^P_{11} = \overline{E \wedge D_X \wedge A_1}$</td>
    <td>$Q^P_{21} = \overline{E \wedge \overline{D_X} \wedge A_2}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="spacing"><td><div/></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$Q^N_{11} = E \wedge \overline{D_X} \wedge A_1$</td>
    <td>$Q^N_{21} = E \wedge D_X \wedge A_2$</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<h4>Combining the $X$ and $Y$ drive addressing</h4>

<div class="marginnote">Translating from &lsquo;currents in lines&rsquo; to &lsquo;address and data&rsquo;.</div>
<p>
Recall that the current-driving circuitry consists of two instances of
this driving circuit, horizontal and vertical.  We thus have bits $A_1$,
$A_2$, and $D_X$ for the first instance and $A_3$, $A_4$, and $D_Y$,
say, for the second.  We can generate a switching field in either
direction for any of our 32 cores by choosing values for these six bits,
and then controlling transistor bases accordingly.  Furthermore, looking
back at section 2.6, we see that the
tuple $(A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4)$ determines a pair of anti-coincident
partner cores and that it is the value of $A_0 := D_X \oplus D_Y$ that
distinguishes between these two partner cores.  Therefore we
reparameterise our six control bits in terms of the five-bit address
$A_4A_3A_2A_1A_0$ and the single data bit $D := D_X$.  We then have $D_Y
= D_X \oplus A_0$.  The 32 cores are now numbered, since each core has a
unique five-bit address $A_4A_3A_2A_1A_0$.  The layout of these
addresses in the $8\times 4$ array may appear a little haphazard, but
this does not matter.


<h4><span class="heading-number">3.3</span> Sensing</h4>

<div class="marginnote">How to detect the bulging switching signal?</div>
<p>
With the current-driving and addressing circuitry in place, it remains
only to describe how to detect the presence or absence of a
core-switching signal on the sense line.  We chose the comparator-based
circuit described in <a href="#Hilpert">[1]</a> (and apparently of unknown German
origin):
<center>
<img style="padding-bottom: 0.75em" src="sense_circuit.png" width=440 height=229>
</center>
The sense line, described above, is threaded once through each of the 32
cores, and its ends are connected to the lines marked $SA$ and $SB$.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">Need to detect positive and negative sense bulges.</div>
<p>
The obvious two-fold symmetry of this circuit reflects the possibility
that a sense pulse from a switching core can bias $SA$ positively or
negatively relative to $SB$ depending on whether a core is switching
from a clockwise to an anti-clockwise magnetisation state relative to
the sense line or vice-versa.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">With an input of at least $\pm$20mV, one comparator&rsquo;s
  output goes high.</div>
<p>
The resistors ensure that, when no voltage is present across $SA$/$SB$,
each comparator&rsquo;s inverting input is 20mV above its non-inverting,
and so both outputs are low.  If a positive sense pulse occurs, causing
$SA$ to rise more than 20mV above $SB$, the left comparator will
detect this and output &lsquo;high&rsquo;.  Conversely for a negative sense pulse,
the right comparator will fire.  We <span class="textsc">or</span> the two to detect pulses
of either polarity.  The threshold of 20mV was chosen by experiment.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">Capture sense output at the right moment.</div>
<p>
<div style="float:right; padding-left:1.5em"><img src="latch-sense-output.png" width=180></div>
The final detail of the sense circuitry is that we used a timed latch to
catch and store the output of the <span class="textsc">or</span> gate at the appropriate
moment.  This ensures that we are not affected by any high comparator
outputs caused by the transformer-action spikes.  The timer delay was
chosen by experiment as 650ns, although any value 500&ndash;900ns worked.

<h4><span class="heading-number">4.1</span> Complete circuit</h4>

Combining these pieces, we arrive at the final circuit, which we give in
appendix A.  The design splits the shield into a driver
board and a plug-in core board, as shown in this photograph of the
two boards plugged into the Arduino:

<h4><span class="heading-number">4.2</span> Fabrication</h4>

<div class="marginnote">Our design files are available.</div>
<p>
We finally achieved our goal of building a core memory shield by having
our schematics fabricated as PCBs.  Owing to some late design changes,
we then had to patch the boards slightly; the circuits described here
include the changes.  Eagle files for these schematics and PCBs as well
as the Gerber files are
available <a href="Core-Memory-Shield.zip">here</a>.  Also contained in
the Eagle files are the part numbers for the various components
(transistors, logic gates, comparators, etc.) that we used.

<h4><span class="heading-number">4.3</span> API and testing</h4>

<div class="marginnote">How to write to and read from the cores from Arduino code.</div>
<p>
Once the core board, driver board and Arduino have been appropriately
mated, it is easy to use the Arduino to read from and write to the core
memory array.  To send a write pulse to a core, the Arduino writes the
data bit to digital pin 8, writes the address of
the core in question to digital pins 3&ndash;7 and then asserts
<span class="textsc">enable</span> (digital pin 2) for 2us.  Once this is
done, reading digital pin 9 reveals whether the core changed
state.  Cycle time is such that a 32-bit operation takes 0.5ms,
although preliminary experiments suggest that by being more aggressive
on the timings we could bring this down to 0.3ms.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">A simple API and serial-based CLI is available.</div>
<p>
These operations are presented as the functions <span class="pre">write_bit</span> and
<span class="pre">read_bit</span>.  Loops turn these into <span class="pre">write_word</span> and
<span class="pre">read_word</span>, to act on the whole core board as a single 32-bit
unsigned integer.  A further natural operation is a <span class="emph">bit exchange</span>.
This, in one operation, writes a new data bit to a core, and returns the
old value, which can be deduced as (latched-sense-output) <span class="textsc">xor</span>
(new-data).  The source-code for this API, with a command-line interface
presented on the serial port, is available for
download <a href="Core-Memory-Shield.zip">here</a>.
<p>
<div class="marginnote">The core memory shield performed error-free for 10bln
  operations, running for 100hrs.</div>
<p>
We used this interface to extensively test the core memory shield.
After running continuously for over one hundred hours, the shield had
performed over ten billion successful bit-exchange operations without
a single error.



<h3 style="clear: both"><span class="heading-number">5</span> Final words</h3>

We hope that our work here might encourage others to take an interest in
both the theory and the practice of core memory.  For further reading,
excellent descriptions are given by Hilpert <a href="#Hilpert">[1]</a> and by
Jones <a href="#Jones">[4]</a>.
<p>
Building a reliable 32-bit core memory shield for the Arduino proved to
be a natural stopping point for our work, but there is certainly more
that could be done.  Some ideas for future work that appealed to us:
<ul>
  <li>Many core memory arrays from the heyday of core memory still exist
  and indeed are easy to find for sale (e.g., on eBay).  It might be a
  fun challenge to build a driver module to write to and read from these
  old arrays.  Perhaps with care and luck one could even recover some
  50-year-old data?
  <li>A completely different approach to core memory, with a
  non-destructive read cycle, was invented by Eiichi Goto in the
  mid-1950s, and was incorporated in the Japanese Parametron Computer 1
  (see <a href="#Wada">[7]</a> for a description).  It would be very interesting to
  re-implement this significantly different core memory technology.
  <li>In practice, a group of core memory modules of the type described
  here, known as <span class="emph">planes</span>, were combined into a core store.  All planes
  could be accessed simultaneously by introducing an <span class="emph">inhibit</span>
  line <a href="#Jones">[4]</a>.  Constructing an 8-bit wide store would be a
  worthwhile challenge.
</ul>

The terminating resistor across the sense loop provides a path for the
current caused by the induced voltage round the loop.
