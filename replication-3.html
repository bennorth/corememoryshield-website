    <h2>2025-08-24</h2>

    <p>We received an enquiry in November 2024 from Joshua Silver, who was considering making
      the core memory shield for a school project.  Joshua had to make a few changes to our
      original design, as he had sourced his own cores and so some component values needed
      adjusting, and other components were not readily available.  We were happy to discuss his
      questions with him over email, and he got the core memory working. With his permission, we
      are pleased to publish some of his photos and other resources here.</p>

    <h4>Photos</h4>

    <h4>Project poster</h4>

    <p>Joshua presented his work in the form of a poster:</p>

    <p>Thanks to Joshua for these resources and permission to use them.</p>
